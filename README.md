# Transport Management System

This is a Java-based Transport Management System (TMS) API service.

## Getting Started

The server should run automatically when starting a workspace. To run manually, use the following command:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Database Schema

Below is the database schema for the Transport Management System. You can create one using a tool like [draw.io](https://draw.io) and embed it here.

## Test Coverage

I have not tested my project. So the test coverage is very less.
